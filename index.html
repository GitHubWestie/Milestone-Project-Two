            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <p>Click on the cards below to reveal the face of the card. You can only view the face of two cards at a time so remember the position of them as you turn them over!<br> Once matched, a pair of cards will remain face up. Once all pairs have been revealed the game is over. Aim to use as few clicks as possible and complete the game as fast as possible. <br> Good luck!</p>
