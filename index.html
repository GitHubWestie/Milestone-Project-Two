            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <p>Click on the cards below to reveal the face of the card. You can only view the faces of two cards at a time so remember the position of them as you turn them over! <br> Once matched, a pair of cards will remain face up and once all pairs have been revealed, the game is over. <br> Aim to use as few clicks as possible and complete the game as fast as possible. <br> Good luck!</p>
